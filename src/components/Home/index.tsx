            with over 6 years of experience, I specialize in React Native and
            Android Native development, creating user- friendly,
            high-performance, and scalable mobile applications. My extensive
            expertise across mobile platforms enables me to contribute to every
            phase of your project â€” from concept and development to testing,
            deployment, and ongoing maintenance.
